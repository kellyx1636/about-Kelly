#### Bio: 
I am a 16 year-old girl, who is interested in computers and how it impacts the world. I believe that I started using a computer when I was 8 and I did not know how the background work that it involved. Ever since I signed up for SEP, I discovered the different proramming languages that can be used for many purposes. I plan on expanding my knowledge of computer science in college.
